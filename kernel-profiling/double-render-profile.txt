    OPT   Compute is more heavily utilized than Memory: Look at the Compute Workload Analysis section to see what the
          compute pipelines are spending their time doing. Also, consider whether any computation is redundant and
          could be reduced or moved to look-up tables.

    OPT   Est. Speedup: 86.98%
          The ratio of peak float (fp32) to double (fp64) performance on this device is 64:1. The workload achieved
          close to 0% of this device's fp32 peak performance and 20% of its fp64 peak performance. If Compute Workload
          Analysis determines that this workload is fp64 bound, consider using 32-bit precision floating point
          operations to improve its performance. See the Kernel Profiling Guide
          (https://docs.nvidia.com/nsight-compute/ProfilingGuide/index.html#roofline) for more details on roofline
          analysis.

    OPT   FP64 is the highest-utilized pipeline (88.5%) based on active cycles, taking into account the rates of its
          different instructions. It executes 64-bit floating point operations. The pipeline is over-utilized and
          likely a performance bottleneck. Based on the number of executed instructions, the highest utilized pipeline
          (88.5%) is FP64 (FP64). It executes non-DMMA 64-bit floating point operations. Comparing the two, the
          overall pipeline utilization appears to be caused by frequent, low-latency instructions. See the Kernel
          Profiling Guide (https://docs.nvidia.com/nsight-compute/ProfilingGuide/index.html#metrics-decoder) or hover
          over the pipeline name to understand the workloads handled by each pipeline. The Instruction Statistics
          section shows the mix of executed instructions for this workload.
